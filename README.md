## About the project

Full design and development of a single-page website for a real client. The goal was to create an attractive, functional experience that lets the owner showcase her products, present subscription plans, and receive orders directly through WhatsApp — with no backend or third-party platforms required.

## Technical decisions

**No frameworks** — Chose plain HTML/CSS/JS to keep the site lightweight, skip build steps, and maintain full control over the output.

**WhatsApp integration without a backend** — Instead of a server to handle form submissions, the form encodes user data into a `wa.me` URL, redirecting directly to a pre-filled WhatsApp conversation.

**`IntersectionObserver` for scroll animations** — Used the native browser API instead of libraries like AOS, keeping the project dependency-free.
